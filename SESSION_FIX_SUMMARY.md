# Session Cache Fix - Summary

## The Problem You Described

> "Users are not there on Supabase (only one new user), but the other previous logins with the other emails are still linked to the account. When I login it logs in. It does not assume the user exists. Is this being stored somewhere?"

**YES!** The sessions are stored in **browser local storage**.

---

## What's Happening

1. **Browser Cache**: Supabase stores JWT authentication tokens in your browser's `localStorage`
2. **Valid Tokens**: Even though users are deleted from the database, their tokens remain valid for ~1 hour
3. **No Database Check**: By default, the app doesn't verify if the user still exists in `public.users` on every page load

---

## The Fix (3 Parts)

### Part 1: Clear Browser Cache (Immediate Fix)

**Quick Method:**
1. Press **F12** in your browser
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click **Local Storage** → Your localhost URL
4. Find keys starting with `sb-`
5. Right-click → **Delete** or click **Clear All**
6. **Refresh** the page (F5)

**Easier Method:**
Go to: `http://localhost:5173/clear-cache.html`
- Click "Clear Supabase Cache"
- Automatically clears all auth data and redirects

---

### Part 2: Updated Auth Hook (Automatic Protection)

I updated `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` to add a safety check:

**What It Does:**
- When the app loads or user logs in
- It checks if the user exists in `public.users` table
- If user NOT found → Automatically signs out
- If user found → Allows access

**The Code Change:**
```typescript
// Now checks public.users before allowing access
const { data: publicUser, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('id, username, role, name, created_at, updated_at')
  .eq('id', session.user.id)
  .single();

if (error || !publicUser) {
  // User deleted from public.users but has valid auth token
  await supabase.auth.signOut(); // Force sign out
  return;
}
```

**Result:** Deleted users can't access the app even with valid tokens! 🎉

### Part 3: Database Migration (Prevents Future Issues)

The migration `20250101000008_fix_user_sync.sql` adds:
- Auto-sync trigger between `auth.users` and `public.users`
- Cleanup of orphaned records
- Proper foreign key constraints

---

## Step-by-Step Fix Instructions

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache

**Option A - Use the Tool:**
```
http://localhost:5173/clear-cache.html
```

**Option B - Manual:**
1. F12 → Application → Local Storage
2. Delete all `sb-*` keys
3. Refresh

### Step 2: Verify Users in Supabase

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Authentication** → **Users**
3. You should only see 1 user (your new test user)
4. If you see old users → Delete them (3 dots menu → Delete)

### Step 3: Apply Database Migration

**Via Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20250101000008_fix_user_sync.sql`
3. Click **RUN**

**Via CLI:**
```bash
cd "/Users/keletsontseno/Downloads/EHR APP"
supabase db push
```

### Step 4: Test

1. Try logging in with deleted user credentials
   - Should show "Invalid credentials" error
2. Try logging in with valid credentials
   - Should work normally

---

## Why This Happened

### The Sequence of Events:

1. You deleted users from `public.users` table (via SQL or Table Editor)
2. BUT `auth.users` records still existed
3. Browser had valid JWT tokens cached
4. Tokens were still valid (not expired)
5. App allowed login because token was valid
6. App crashed because `public.users` record missing

### The Root Causes:

1. **Wrong Deletion Method**: Deleted from `public.users` instead of Authentication → Users
2. **No Validation**: App didn't check if user exists in `public.users`
3. **Cached Sessions**: Browser stored old login tokens

## How Data Flows

### Before (Broken):

```
User logs in
  ↓
Token stored in browser
  ↓
User deleted from public.users (but not auth.users)
  ↓
User refreshes page
  ↓
App loads, sees valid token
  ↓
App tries to load user from public.users
  ↓
CRASH! User not found
```

### After (Fixed):

```
User logs in
  ↓
Token stored in browser
  ↓
User deleted properly (Authentication → Users)
  ↓
Cascades to public.users
  ↓
User refreshes page
  ↓
App loads, sees valid token
  ↓
App checks if user exists in public.users
  ↓
User not found! → Automatically sign out
  ↓
Redirects to login page ✅
```

## Going Forward: Proper User Deletion

### ✅ CORRECT Way:

**Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Find the user
3. Click **3 dots** → **Delete User**
4. Confirm

**What This Does:**
- Deletes from `auth.users`
- CASCADE deletes from `public.users`
- Invalidates all active sessions
- User can't log in anymore

---

### ❌ WRONG Way:

**SQL Editor or Table Editor:**
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = '...';
```

**Why This is Bad:**
- Only deletes from `public.users`
- `auth.users` record remains
- User can still log in
- App crashes when user logs in
- Creates orphaned records

## Testing Checklist

After applying all fixes:

### Browser Cache Test:
- [ ] Clear browser local storage
- [ ] Refresh page
- [ ] Should see login page

- [ ] Delete test user from Authentication → Users
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Try logging in with deleted credentials
- [ ] Should show "Invalid credentials"

### Valid User Test:
- [ ] Create new user via registration

## Common Questions

### Q: Why can deleted users still log in for a while?

**A:** JWT tokens are stateless and valid until they expire (typically 1 hour). The fix ensures that even with valid tokens, deleted users can't access the app.

### Q: Will this log out all users when I apply the fix?

**A:** No, only deleted users will be signed out. Valid users will continue to work normally.

### Q: Do I need to clear cache on production?

**A:** No, the auth hook update handles this automatically. Users with deleted accounts will be signed out automatically when they try to access the app.

### Q: What if I see "orphaned" users in the database?

**A:** Run the migration. It will clean up:
- Users in `public.users` without `auth.users` records
- Consultation notes with non-existent doctors

## Quick Commands Reference

### Clear Supabase Cache (Browser Console):
```javascript
Object.keys(localStorage)
  .filter(key => key.startsWith('sb-'))
  .forEach(key => localStorage.removeItem(key));
location.reload();
```

### Check for Orphaned Users (SQL):
```sql
-- Users in public.users but not auth.users
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users);

-- Users in auth.users but not public.users
SELECT au.id, au.email FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN users u ON au.id = u.id
WHERE u.id IS NULL;
```

### Verify User Count Matches:
```sql
SELECT 'auth.users' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM auth.users
UNION ALL
SELECT 'public.users' as table_name, COUNT(*) FROM users;
-- Both should return the same count
```

## Summary

**What You Need to Do:**

1. ✅ Clear browser cache (use `/clear-cache.html` or manual method)
2. ✅ Delete old users from **Authentication → Users** (not SQL!)
3. ✅ Apply database migration (`20250101000008_fix_user_sync.sql`)
4. ✅ Test login with valid credentials

**What's Fixed:**

1. ✅ Browser cache won't allow deleted users to access app
2. ✅ Auth hook now verifies user exists before allowing access
3. ✅ Database sync ensures no mismatches in future
4. ✅ Proper cleanup of orphaned records

**Prevention:**

- Always delete users via **Authentication → Users** in Supabase Dashboard
- Never delete directly from `public.users` table
- Use the migration's auto-sync trigger for new registrations

---

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and ready to test
**Priority**: HIGH (Security issue - allows deleted users to access app)
**Testing Required**: Yes - verify deleted users can't log in
